0	5	0	0	0	their prices may be higher than some asian cleaners but their quality of service is excellent. it really shows they take care of their customers clothing. i have never had my shirts packed so nicely when i pick them up at other cleaners. and looking over their work i found no flaws. ...  ... you get what you pay for here. and i will continue to be their customer :)
0	1	0	0	0	I had a very bad experience with the store.  Very rude seamstress. She cost the company she works for money because my husband and I will never go there again.  If you are looking for a friendly family business, do not go to Boston cleaners on West Charleston they are expensive, rude and unfriendly.
0	5	0	0	0	I was on vacation and found this cleaners in the area. They were super friendly and the place is clean. The prices are a bit higher then other places, but they found some casino chips in my pants pocket and returned them to me when I picked up my clothes! VERY IMPRESSED!
2	4	0	0	1	Burgers, Fries and a milkshake. Life doesn't get any better. The burgers are really good and so are the fries. But what really sticks out are the milkshakes. The Oreo milkshake is my favorite and I cannot get enough. This is the place to go to satisfy that burger, fries and a milkshake craving after a hot summer day of chilling by the pool.
2	5	0	1	1	Everyone in my family was sad to see this place close down several years ago but we were all excited to see it open again on a recent trip.  Great fries, great garden burgers (most of us are vegetarian) and great milkshakes.  A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!).
2	4	1	2	1	I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it.  4 stars for the diner category.  Our first visit here was for brunch.  I tried out the Carnitas Skillet.  It was good, but I discovered carnitas is not great in a scramble.  The potatoes were great.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros and was gracious enough to share with me...good stuff. ...  ... The kids had a burger & mac' n cheese.  Both were good.  The staff here was very friendly and helpful and every request for this or that was met with a "sure!". ...  ... Our waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on.  I thought she was hitting on my wife as she kept referring to her as "sweetie" or "honey" or "babe" or...but by midway through the meal this had transferred to all of us.
3	3	0	0	0	3 1/2 STARS ...  ... This is Marriott's TIME-SHARE complex across from their luxury hotel. We traded a time-share for a week here in May. I must say, the place was packed - it appeared to be fully occupied. ...  ... Our room was small but just fine for us. The employees were all friendly and the grounds were kept in good shape. ...  ... We found this to be a good place to use as a base for a week's holiday while taking day-trips to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, Prescott, Scottsdale, the Phoenix Botanical Garden, and so on...
3	4	1	3	0	My friend got the time-share suite (2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and 2 balaconys).  SWEET!  We had a wonderful time enoying complex.  The grounds were well kept.   ...  ... The pool area was walking distance.  2 large pools (1 pool had a waterfall, volleyball, and basketball), 2 hot tub areas, 1 kiddie pool.   ...  ... Stayaction for the weekend!
3	5	0	3	0	I traded my lockout unit (Extra bedroom) from Desert Springs Marriott Villas in Palm Desert for a one bedroom, living room and dinning area and kitchen. The unit was on the third floor end unit which had a terrific view of the Wildfire Faldo golf course.  ...  ... Marriott Vacation Club is awesome. I've owned the two bedroom unit in Palm Desert location for 16 years and also a two bedroom week in Newport Beach Coast for eleven years. The program is nice BC it allows me to occupy, trade, rent, deposit outside of Marriott or trade my weeks for reward points or vacation points.  ...  ... Canyon Villas is located at the JW Marriott which is great due to you'll have all the amenities of the hotel pool, spa, hotel restaurants, and two 18 hole golf courses within minutes of your villa. If you choose to use the villa amenities  there are several pools, a fitness center, beach volleyball, and daily activities.  ...  ... I highly recommend ownership in Marriott vacation club, the program has enabled me to travel to Phuket & Bangkok Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, Xian, & Beijing China, Bali & Singapore Indonesia, Ho Chi Men Vietnam, several islands in Hawaii, Paris France, Cancun, Puerta Vallarta Mexico, Boston, several cities in Florida, West Virgina, Manhattan, New Orleans, Hilton Head and Savannah. I know i'm missing some places but you get the drift.  ...  ... I've never been let down with Marriott Vacation Club locations that's why I try to stay within the Marriott family - with other timeshares you don't know what your getting. Another pointer is never buy outside the U.S. International Timeshares go under and your screwed. I had a co worker that had that happen in a resort in Mexico.
3	5	0	3	0	This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been on. It was spacious and their bathroom alone was ginormous!!! I would definitely keep going back whenever I'm in town.
3	4	0	1	2	My roomie's father has this timeshare thingy and selected this place and invited us to fly out here. ...  ... Wow!  The Marriott Canyon Villas is one of the nicest places that I've stayed at.  We basically stayed at a huge suite with an adjoining room.  Big kitchen.  Large living room.  Furnished balconies.  Big bathroom.  Washer and dryer included.  You're bound to have a grand time here. ...  ... Except...the beds.  I found the bed to be a little too soft for my comfort.  After my second night there, I spent the rest of the week tossing and turning.  My roomie found better comfort on the couch.  I should have just slept on the floor. ...  ... Everything else was great!  The hot spa was heavenly.  The sauna was relaxing.  The gym is open 24 hours.  There were adequate games available to keep people, especially kids, busy.  There is a mini-convenience store where you can also rent DVDs.   ...  ... Canyon Villas couldn't have picked a better location than at Desert Ridge.  If you go out for a walk or a run, you can't miss this huge beautiful golf course.  In addition, you're bound to see wild quails running around.  Don't be surprised if you spot a jackrabbit here and there.  Plenty of nature sceneries here. ...  ... Friendly staff here.  Awesome place that just need to improve their beds.
3	2	2	4	1	Looking at the schedule of the resort activities upon arrival, we learned that Wednesday was a cowboy sing-along. No, I'm not shitting you. I love my family and we had a great time being with each other, but that really epitomized our opinion of this hokey old-person resort.  ...  ... If you have a timeshare somewhere like Vegas or the Poconos, this place might be worth your while to swap. For us (a family that owns our timeshare in Maui), it was quite a downward step.  ...  ... The room was smaller than our unit in Hawaii, which made little sense; it wasn't dirty, but also didn't feel as clean as other properties we've been to; a light was burned out in our room and the maintenance people neglected to fix it; and the workout room smelled like formaldehyde.  ...  ... The Marriott hotel across the way, however, is ridiculously luxurious. So if you're not bound to renting through the timeshare, you should stay over there instead. If you are bound to the timeshare, you can still use their pools, which is well worth it.
3	4	0	0	0	friendly staff, looks clean, great room amenities. their gym is right in front of the lobby with windows for all to see you sweat. no cardio machines. small snack shop w/ decent prices. bring your own spices for their kitchen.  look for luggage cart to move your things to and from car. free parking and wifi is a plus!
3	4	0	1	0	everything your family needs is on this property. space, cleanliness, modern kitchen, 2 pools, 1 kiddie pool, golf, fitness room, satellite TV, free parking, free wifi, grills on property to BBQ and rabbits for your kids to chase.  ...  ... there is a strip mall not too far from property which will cater to all you needs. its about 35min drive from phoenix airport.  nothing real scenic to go to in scottsdale so enjoy the property as much as you can. ...  ... prices are up there for rental and if you purchase things at their thrift store, expect it to be pricey too. employees and customer service was good! ...  ... we had a great time and cant wait to go back next year!
3	5	0	0	0	You will love Canyon Villas.  Address on Yelp is wrong, & I submitted a correction today.  7/9/2011.  We just returned from our 3rd stay at Canyon Villas, which are located at 5220 Marriott Drive, Phoenix,AZ. There are several buildings with studios, 1, & 2 bedroom/2 bath Villas (like condos).  They are sold as timeshare but can also be rented by anyone & traded into by other owners.  Numerous pools, spas, recreation & the nearby Desert Ridge Shopping Center offer much to do.  The villas & resort landscaping are really beautiful.  2 bedrooms sleep up to 8 people.  1 bedroom 4, & studio 4, but studios are better for 2 people max.  Villas have a full kitchen/dining room with dishwasher, washer/dryer, & all have patio or balcony with tables/chairs.  Resort has gas BBQ's scattered around that you can use.  Most of the time you can use pools at JW also, & Marriott has a free shuttle bus that takes you over there & back & also goes to Desert Ridge shopping center which has an Albertson's Market for your food supplies.  IF YOU PLAY GOLF, THERE ARE 2 SEPARATE COURSES NEXT TO THE RESORT, WILDFIRE IS ONE & I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE OTHER.  Take the Marriott timeshare tour, they are not high pressure & you can get $100.00 in Marriott dining dollars, or Marriott Rewards points.  Most people buy with Marriott as they are the premier timeshare company & owners love the resorts.  They now sell MVC points & you have no home resort, instead of timeshare weeks. It gives you freedom of reserving your time at any of the resorts.   Lots of wildlife live in the resort, owls, quail, rabbits and more.  You will love it!   Go to www.Marriott.com for more information.  No, I don't work for Marriott, but we are loyal and love the Marriott level of service and quality.
3	5	0	2	0	First off, ignore the review from Jen S. 1/19/2011, as it doesn't fall in with other reviewers & we have stayed here 3 summers for the week each time. Canyon Villas is beautiful inside & out & very clean.  If you ever have a problem call to report it & they will fix it quickly.  Hispanic maids at hotels never seem to report stuff like clogged drains or leaky faucets, etc.(in my experience).  Marriott service is amazing. Yes, they do have a cowboy singer who is at the firepit for about an hour so, who plays a guitar, but you don't have to sign along, & it is not a detriment.  This resort is not for old people, or hokey in the least.  It is beautiful with multiple pools on site (as well as those you can use at the adjacent Marriott JW Hotel).  The rooms at the hotel are smaller & no kitchen/washer dryer, etc.  If you like to cook your own meals, like having a balcony with table/chairs, dishwasher, & all amenities, incl. granite counters throughout, then the Villas are for you.  They can be rented by the night using Marriott reservations number or www.marriott.com.  Select Marriott Vacation Club for the search by hotel type & enter Phoenix.  There are now DVD players in every room, the "studio" (lockoff unit), the 1 bedroom master & the living room.  These 3 components equal a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit.  You can rent 2 bedroom as stated, or just the studio with mini kitchen (small fridge, microwave), living room, sleeper sofa & king bed, full bathroom.  The 1 bedroom is the master unit with separate bedroom, bathroom with large shower, sink & toilet, plus a large soaking tub & 2nd sink.  Living room also has a dining table that sits 6 people with included chairs.  Marriott is upgrading sleeper sofas in all units when they come up for renovations to a new type that was tested at Marriott Villas Mountainside Park City Utah.  They are made by American Leather & are memory foam mattresses that fold out & are much, much better than the existing standard metal frame & lumpy old mattresses.   No telling when all locations will have them.   There is a special kids pool area at the north end of the Villas resort.  It has sprayers in the concrete, etc.  There is also a separate playground area between some of the buildings at the north end.  Each building is 3 stories high & each building has an elevator.  Generally these units are pretty quiet in my experience.  I have found the Canyon Villas to have a very good maid staff & they are very clean.  We usually trade our week for a week each year at Canyon Villas because we love it.  I love the desert & the landscaping & wildlife at Canyon Villas is just beautiful.  There is a free shuttle to the JW each hour & they go to Desert Ridge Shopping Center every 2 hours on the even hour.  Desert Ridge has BJ's Brewpub, Barnes & Noble, Dave & Busters entertainment,a large movie theatre, Kohls, & numerous other large restaurants & shopping.  You also get your groceries to stock the villa there at Albertsons (a great market).    We always can't wait to go back every year.   There is lots to do if you want to venture out, like the Phoenix Art Museum, Bot. Gardens, Zoo, Arizona Rock & Mineral Museum, visit the State Capital building, etc.  There is Wildfire Golf Course on one side of the property & another amazing Golf course on the other side.   Oh, the beds are the same as in the JW, firm, but have a pillow topper on them.  Super comfortable always!  Also, as the units are updated, they are going to have all stainless steel appliances.   If you do the highly recommended Marriott tour, you will see the updated unit they use for showing.  Marriott is a great company & timeshare tours are not high pressure.  It is a great product & well worth buying into.  They no longer sell weeks, just points & you no longer are tied to a home resort.  You can use your points annually for where ever you want to stay.  You buy a point value & still pay maint. fees based on the point value you buy.
3	5	0	1	0	We just got back from a weekend at the Villas and everything was fantastic. Great service, beautiful rooms (we had two two-bedroom condos), beautiful grounds. The beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked for cooking.  We also used the gas grills to BBQ.   ...  ... We were really impressed with the staff both at the Villas and at the main resort (Marriott Desert Ridge) across the street. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, even in the 105 summer temperatures. For pool time we preferred the Marriott/hotel side of the resort (the Villas office will provide you with a wristband to get pool access there).   The main hotel has two pools and a lazy river.   There are two pools at the Villas but the area is smaller and it feels more crowded.  The hotel also has a few restaurants, including a Roy's with patio seating and happy hour from 4 to 6pm.  Although we spent a lot of time on the hotel side of this resort, I always prefer the condos for kicking back, relaxing and for eating in when we want to.  ...  ... We'll definitely go back.
3	5	0	1	0	Back after one year but instead I traded my efficiency unit for a two bedroom - scored! ... The staff filled my request and gave me a high floor and golf course view. ...  ... The two bedroom was spacious and I really enjoyed the extra bedroom and bathroom. HD Direct TV was included and wireless internet is also complimentary. Staying here also gave access to the JW Marriott fitness center and pool and I utilized the Revive Spa with a Swedish massage. The Canyon villas offers shuttle service to the JW Marriott every half hour or you can take a 10 minute walk over which you can dine at 4 different restaurants and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. ...  ... For those of you who don't know me I enjoy golfing and the Phoenix area has 119 public golf courses. I can visit the area and play different courses at various price ranges. The Marriott resort has two 18 hole golf courses one designed by Arnold Palmer and the other by Nick Faldo and both are upscale and in great condition. ...  ... So if your into spa, golf, dinning or all of the above check out Marriott Canyon Villas.
3	4	0	0	0	After spending endless time looking at condos on VRBO and other properties, we settled on the Canyon Villas, and were really, really happy with the decision.  ... In looking at traveling with kids, and with family in the area that we wanted to spend time with, we thought it was critical to have a full kitchen and ample space for us to spread out.  The Canyon Villas have all of this, and at a very high level.  ... We chose a ground floor 1-bedroom unit that backed onto the courtyard, which includes 2 shuffleboard courts, numerous gas fire pits, and three spotless grills.  It was ideal for family, and we used the grills nightly, which ended up being a great place to meet the other owners/renters. ...   ... The staff was superb, and the property was spotless.  ...  ... You do have access to the JW Marriott across the street, either via an on-the-half-hour shuttle or by walking.  In our case, the shuttle driver was under-utilized, and was basically on call, which was spectacular.  The JW is a gorgeous property, and the pool/lazy-river is top notch.  They have super-pricey dining options if you are leaning that way.   ...  ... Not having to eat out for every meal made fora very relaxing time, and not having to really venture off of the property for entertainment was even better.  The pools at the villas themselves are more than adequate for just about everybody - they just lack the lazy river - but have food & drink service, fountains, air hockey, etc. ...  ... It isn't cheap, but they have military and AAA discounts (we used AAA and saved a few bucks).  It really balances out if you do your cooking in the unit or on the grills - there is a very complete Albertsons less than 5 minutes away, along with a massive strip mall with any number of awful chain restaurants that you might want to utilize.   ...  ... For golfers - $199 seems absurd for a resort course, so I didn't play Wildfire.  Shop golfnow.com - there are deals everywhere in Phoenix on good courses - I found Legend Trail (~15 minutes North) for half that amount.   ...  ... Highly recommended.
3	4	0	1	0	This is a great family resort if you need a villa with a kitchen, washer/dryer and space. We have stayed at Marriott Vacation Clubs all over the U.S. and we really love it here. It's not too big but is in a perfect location for us. You can use the pool at the JW Marriott across the way, but my kids loved the pool here and it's easier to use. The pool was heated to a perfect temperature!  Across the way is the Desert Ridge Marketplace with an Albertson's, 24 hour CVS, Einstein bagels, many other fun restaurants, AMC movies, big box shopping like Marshall's, Ross, etc. It's very convenient for shopping and dining as well as getting to the 101 highway for all of the fun places to go nearby.  ...  ... I also found a great nail place across from Desert Ridge called "All About Nails". Very nice and very clean - plus reasonably priced. ...  ... We will return when we need a Scottsdale base for vacation. Our only complaint was check in was 2.5 hours late (6:30 PM instead of 4:00 PM), and the lack of pool towels on 2 days. Otherwise a well-run vacation club.
3	5	1	1	1	This place is awesome.  The place is beautiful and immaculate.  The golf course in front is stunning and I hope to play here in April.  There is a huge shopping mall with a supermarket, movie place and shopping so we made dinner in our condo tonight.  There is a lighted lounge area outside my room with BBQ grilles and shuffleboard courts.  The bathtub is huge and my wife loved taking a long bubble bath.
3	5	0	0	0	Great views, great customer service.
3	3	0	0	0	The rooms are absolutely first class, but I would not consider staying here again.  A few hours across the street at the JW Marriott proved most relaxing.  Unfortunately, it is a bit of a hassle to get over there.  There is nothing really in walking distance, and you need to drive a good distance to find a decent place to eat.
3	4	1	3	2	You can bet it will be a nice resort if it carries the Marriott name.  ...  ... They are consistent, even though some are still nicer than others.  Canyon Villas is located in upper Phoenix where the air is a bit cleaner, the view a bit nicer, open spaces and grand desert views, but still conveniently close to amenities. Accessible to the freeway and lots of shopping, it is living the good life. Well.....maybe not when it is 122 degrees outside, or a torrential monsoonal rain that can float your car away, or even a nasty dust storm.  Yes, it can have it's occasional down sides. ...  ... There are plenty of directions to go to find good food, entertainment, educational attractions, culture. I do lots of Yelp research and Grouponing for about a week or two before I come here, just to catch up on what's to do and see around here.   ...  ... The villas are beautiful and comfortable, good beds too. And then you have gorgeous desert landscaping, beautiful pools, patios, golf courses, a spa, kids' play areas, and fun scheduled activities (how about duct tape wallet making for one) if you would rather not go out in your car. Add to that the neighboring JW Marriott, with all its finery, with shuttle service every half hour to and from the resort. If you stay at this resort, all those things are part of the package. ...  ... And it is a convenient ~5 1/2 hour trip from Los Angeles area. ...  ... Mr. B and I like it here.
3	5	0	0	0	Bought here 8 years ago with absolutely no regrets.  The villas are wonderfully appointed and the atmosphere is great.  The staff goes above and beyond to come up with activities at the Villas.  Access to the main resort makes it equally appealing.  Also a short distance from lots of great dining and shopping.
3	5	0	0	0	I'm an owner and I am critical, but I couldn't be more impressed with the Canyon Villas.  The Staff - remembered my name and building.   ... The shuttle driver - remember my building and information ... The JW Marriott - was available ever 30 minutes via shuttle ... The Pool staff at JW Marriott - was friendly and explained what/how to enjoy the facilities ... The Marketing Staff - was not pushy and made me want to come back.  ... The tour guides - informative and fun ... The Cowboy Singer - had a great voice and did a wonderful Rawhide set ... The only thing I would suggest is that on Monday morning, get mics for the presenters or tell the grounds keepers to lay off the blowers and keep quiet for the one hour so we can hear what is available during the week.   ... I can't wait to come back.  I stayed in a lock off (no kitchen) but bbq'd every night.  Staff brought me a blender (not normally in the lock off) and made my stay wonderful.
3	5	0	0	0	Omg Tyson was the most helpful person I've ever met in the whole world. He made my whole expirence amazing! His awesome attitude was just a step above and beyond the call of duty. He should be the CEO of this place. Or at least a $2.83 raise!!!! Worth every penny of my time and money!!!!!!!!! ...  ...  ... Heart ya Ty!!!!!
4	4	0	0	0	Always packed which is a good sign! Very good food
4	3	3	2	2	Another strip mall joint, this place has pretty good pizza, but their entree items are better. Have had some good lasagna there, and eggplant Parmesan. I just don't like the atmosphere... I feel like I'm dining in a storefront ... Oops, I am!
4	4	1	1	1	I love Nicks!  Casual, consistent, well priced.  Great Osso Bucco, homemade pastas, love the seafood ravioli.  Several locations in the valley but we like the Frank Lloyd Wright one.  Sometimes the service is just ok but lately, seems to have improved.   ... Nothing fancy, just good food at a reasonable price.
4	5	0	0	0	I love this place!they have amazing chicken parm and I love the bread they served with olive oil and vinegar. Not to pricey but a good restaurant. I come here often with my family. Love the small family restaurant. You have to try this place!
4	5	0	0	0	Consistently good Italian food. Reasonably priced wine.  Love the antipasto misto.
4	5	0	0	0	Nick's is the mom and pop of AZ Italian restraunt must! The food is always consitently great! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata. :) It is a very casual place as far as decore but the food is what does it for me.  I would have to agree with Ronald's review below. (The two chair in the middle... worth waiting for a better table)
4	3	4	5	3	I've been to Nick's a couple of times. The place is always mobbed by couples, groups and families. I don't get it, but I guess I'm in the minority on this one. ...  ... The bread is outstanding, the service is ok, but nothing to write home about. The Chicken Parmasean is so so. I only finished one of the two pieces of chicken because it was so meh. And the Linguini with Clams was unspectacular as well.
4	2	1	2	1	The prices are about 2 bucks more than their website.  Their sauce had a lot of sugar, not unlike ChefBoyArDee. The bread seemed like it included cornmeal, not tasty.  The service was just okay.
4	3	0	2	0	A favorite of my wife's. It is not a bad place but nothing exciting it is ok. So when my wife wants to go I usually take her. You know a happy wife makes for a happy me
4	4	0	0	0	Nice local Italian spot. Nice daily specials. Everything is fresh and very tasty with a nice presentation. I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. The one area they need help is with their bread.
4	1	6	7	2	How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana," so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?) ...  ... "Parmagiana" is a style of cooking. "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti. ...  ... God! People can be so stupid.
4	5	0	0	0	LOVE! I love this place the greek salad is so addicting I could eat it everyday.  I always get the spaghetti with tomato sauce its pretty basic but the sauce it very sweet and delish!  It is a neighborhood place where you go in and you will know someone! Overall Excellent!
4	3	3	3	0	For an appropriate metaphor to Nick's restaurant, one need only look to the chicken section of their menu. ...  ... Piccata? Yes, quite. ...  ... Marsala? Ahh, of course, a staple. ...  ... Parmesana? Why certai-- wait. What? What the fuck is Parmesana? I get what Parmesan (Parmigiano) is: it's a dry, hard granular cheese. I'm also familiar with Parmigiana (which means "from Parma," Northern Italy): it's usually used to denote a particular breaded meat/eggplant dish that is bathed in sauce and cheese. Parmesana, on the other hand, isn't a word. One could write it off as a simple spelling error, but they repeat that exact mode in the following veal section. ...  ... So, there it is. Nick's is essentially a generic place that doesn't quite know its identity, and it does it extremely well without anyone ever noticing. ...  ... Nick's is a restaurant for people that are afraid of change; afraid of diversity; afraid of trying something new. While I can't say there's anything wrong with ordering Chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti and Meatballs every time you go out to dinner, it's not for me. After all, Nick's would be ridiculed amongst the pretentious diners of NYC, and I feel similarly. Every time my parents take me there (it is my father's favorite restaurant, which is very telling of his tastes in food) I can't find anything on the menu that sounds interesting enough to pop off the page. When I eat the food, I can't find anything about it that is exceptional enough to remain in my memory. ...  ... But, it is perfectly palatable, freakishly fresh food. I can't help but play devil's advocate and offer the argument that this is a great restaurant for people who like generic American-Italian food and are tired of (or too good for) Olive Garden. You know who you are. Just don't expect any breadsticks at Nick's.
4	5	0	0	0	Best Italian food in north Scottsdale for the money.  If you know of another one, let me know.  Their antipasto misto is the best I've had in AZ. Linguini with clams is to die for :) Very friendly service.  I'll never go back to Macaroni Grill!

4	4	0	1	0	Nick's Italian Restaurant (13910 N. Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ) aims to please with a menu diverse in selection. Tinted windows, location inside a small strip mall on N. Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood.  ...  ... Their traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95).   You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price.  The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste. ...  ... For the main course, the "chicken parmesana" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist.  Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce.  Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish.  There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover.  ...  ... For dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed.  A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips.  It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals. ...  ... With a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food.  With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant.
4	4	0	0	0	Yes, I am a fan of Nick's Italian Resto on FLW in North Scottsdale.  They have a great selection of salads here, works well if you are on a low carb or non processed food diet.  My favorite is the Di Mare salad which I modify to my liking, no shrimp and choice of oil and vinegar dressing.  Vegetarian?  They have caprese salad and pasta choices.  Lunch specials are available too for under $10.00.  The food here is tasty and delicious.  The only drawback to this place is the ambiance and the service.  They have black checked tablecloths, some Italian food decor, looks ordinary.  The service is hit and miss.  Take out is always a good choice.  If you however want good food and great salads, then Nick's is the place...  Buona appetito

I typically get penne with red sauce and sausage. This was the first time I ran out of pasta prior to running out of sausage! That's what I call loading it up with the good stuff! Also had a house salad which was an extra $4 or so (bummer that not included). A variety of different breads to warm you up. Save room for the tiramisu! Even if no room left, make some. Made fresh in house daily and probably some of the best ever.  ...  ... I'm a value guy. If soup or salad was included with the dinner, would have received 5 stars. Not knocking it in any way because it didn't. I'll be going back and see myself becoming a regular.  It was obvious that everyone there was a local!
4	4	0	1	0	tiramisu!!  luckily i ordered a salad and caprase salad so i didn't feel so guity having dessert.  it was very busy when we got there so it must be a fav in the area.  the service was good.  would go back.
4	4	0	0	0	I went here with my mother a couple of weeks ago off from a 'Groupon Now' offer. We shared the chicken picatta. The portion was large and the dish was flavorful. We each added on a side salad - it  was a typical salad for a restaurant, mixed greens with one slice of tomato; per usual, disappointing. However, I got the greek dressing and really liked it.  ... I felt the price was reasonable, but enjoyed it more with the groupon offer. They had a long list of specials that looked good and there were several menu items I would like try. I will check them out again sometime.
4	2	2	3	2	I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and a Groupon brought us in on a busy weekend night.  The place was packed to the gills, the several outdoor "patio" tables also full.  We were told 10 minutes wait.  20 minutes later we were still standing (no available chairs to wait in) against the wall.  (If the Groupon wasn't expiring, we would have left.)  Servers were desparately trying to navigate the tables and the crowded entrance to serve the patio area.  I admired the fact that most still continued to smile in the face of such a crowd.  Finally we were seated in a high traffic area, our chairs were continually bumped with each passing waiter or guest.  This was not fun or relaxing. ...  ... About the food.  Definitely not worth the wait.  We both had salads (because the pasta dishes do not come with any sides).  The wedge salad was covered with bleu cheese dressing, w/ sliced tomatoes and onions on the side.  House salad had a very nice balsamic dressing but the salad was 1 kind of lettuce & a couple cuke & tomato slices - we were not impressed, esp. for the price.  Penne Alla Campagna sounded good w/ spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms & chicken - but it was somewhat bland, chicken was tough.  Lasagna didn't fare much better on our table.   ...  ... I wonder if the experience might have been different on a less busy night.  If they are always this busy, then I guess they won't miss our business.  With all the many choices in Italian, we won't be returning to Nick's.
4	5	2	3	1	LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices. ...  ... I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good.  ...  ... The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal.  ...  ... My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table!  ...  ... A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.
4	3	0	0	0	Pretty decent place. The kids ad pizza and liked it. I had veal parm and it was pretty good. My wife had a seafood pasta special with shrimp and she said it was tasteless all together. The prices seem to be reasonable in regards tithe pizza, but the veal and special were a little expensive for the quantity of veal I got and for the flavorless shrimp pasta combo. The atmosphere is nothing to speak of, almost cafeteria feeling with little or no decor at all. I would go back to try it again I think, but my wife would need more convincing. Overall, not a bad place, but fits in there with your average Scottsdale meal.
4	2	1	1	1	This place gets a big "EH" when it comea to food and service. The bread is clearly NOT fresh. It is cold to room temp at best and the texture gives away the fact it is not far from stale. I ordered the eggplant parm. The breading was too heavy, the sauce bland. Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. My side of steames veggies....cold. I am sure they sat for a long time before my eggplant was plated. My husbands mushroom ravioli in pink sauce was alright, but again the raviolis were clearly not housemade. The food took almost an hour to come out. The prices here are too high for what you get but other than that...I would not return or recommend. The place was busy though, so people must love subpar italian food.
4	3	1	2	0	For a local place, not too far from home, Nicks Italian works. I love their salads, especially for lunch. Pizza deal is great too. I have to be honest though, the past few times we called for "to go" orders, they never say THANK YOU and or a GOODBYE just the phone hanging up on us. I mean, come on! We're spending OUR money at your business and you can't even treat us with some gratitude when we place an order to go, especially when there are other restaurants competing for business??? ...  ... O.k., there is my rant. ...  ... I'll come back for lunch but I am saying goodbye to "orders to go" only because you all are not very pleasant on the phone. ...  ... I really do hope a manager reads this and fixes this problem, STAT.
4	4	0	0	0	I didn't actually go to Nick's, he instead came to me. I used Nick's for a company catering event today, and ordered 3 things: the meat lasagna, the chicken risotto, and the pasta bolognese. All 3 of them were delicious. The meat lasagna went so fast, we ran out of that before we even got into the second pan of risotto or pasta bolognese! It was meaty and hearty and everything a lasagna should be. We also got the spinach salad that was supposed to have cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon on it, but someone in the kitchen was a bit stingy with the cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon. They also brought sliced french bread that I used to sop up my meat sauce and it was the epitome of comfort food. Overall I really enjoyed the food, and would definitely go there on my own.
4	4	1	0	0	Nothing fancy here -- good-sized standard Italian dinners at reasonable prices in a family atmosphere. They have a handful of basic sauces that they put on a wide variety of dishes, ranging from fish to chicken to meat, as well as their homemade pasta. ...  ... A standout is the grilled vegetable salad. Sounds pretty ordinary on its face, but they do a great job with a healthy mix of carrots, zucchini and peppers.  ...  ... The eggplant parm was solid -- several slices of eggplant smothered in mozzarella. Another diner at our table had the housemade sausages (sweet) with homemade fettucine, which also got good reviews.  ...  ... The wine list is short (with a shortage of Italian wines with the except of three Chianti's) but well priced. ...  ... Our waitress said she'd been there with Nicks for 15 years, so she knew the menu inside out and winked when we ordered things she hinted were good. Gotta like that.
4	5	1	0	0	Great food Italian food. All homemade. Owner seems to be on location everyday
4	4	0	3	0	Nick's has great lunch specials! I ordered the Chicken Piccata & got enough of a serving for 2 meals at a fabulously affordable price. Service was awesome, it was also very quiet and not too busy. Don't judge a book by its cover, this place definitely has a "hole in the wall" appearance from the front, but it's gourmet in the back guys!
4	5	1	0	0	Great food! Great service.
4	5	4	4	4	I judge italian food by "Is it worth me making it myself because I can do it much better or is this good enough that I don't need to do the work."  I was raised making italian food and even make pasta from scratch on occasion. I tried Nick's because I got a groupon and I love trying new restaurants this way. About Nick's...I can't even make italian food this good!  ...  ... Everything about the food here exceeded my expectations. The appetizer antipasto combo was an amazing combination of italian meets, cheese, and bruschetta. Each item was fresh and delicious. For the main courses we had the gnocci with meat sauce and baked zitti with sausage. Both were perfect. Great sauce, fresh homemade gnocci and pasta, fabulous!!! For dessert we brought home two cannoli's because we were stuffed. Well that night we got to relive the whole expereince! The canollis are fantastic. Fresh, tasty...I really can't say enough about how good the food was.  ...  ... The atmosphere is great, restaurant is nice and clean, service great...I never have to cook again!!! This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant and probably the only italian restaurant I would recommend to people as being as good as mine! Conceited...I know :)
4	5	3	2	2	Fresh homemade pasta! You can really taste a difference in their sauce and noodles. I was a little concerned going in because of the looks outside, It is in a strip mall and I didn't expect much. Inside was very nice however. The service staff was very friendly and the food was great. The appetizer antipasta platter was the highlight. Fresh meats, peppers, and bruchetta. The canolli's were truly the best I have ever had and they were huge! I think this is now my favorite italian restaurant. The pizza's looked really good and I will be back to try them. My daughter remarked that the capuccino that she had was excellent as well. Portions were good and I had some to bring home.
4	5	1	0	0	Excellent and consistent..reasonable prices
4	3	0	2	0	The baked ziti with sausage is a good choice. Pizza is alright but you have to like a thicker and more toasted crust.
4	5	0	0	0	Hot dang diggity dawg, this is as good as it gets! ...  ... In all seriousness, throw any of your plans for tonight out the window and go to Nick's. Their pizza is superb, their bread is binge-worthy, and the wait is short. Even their plain cheese pizza has a similar taste to my various fantasies of feasts in the heavenly afterlife. ...  ... They also have a variety of pasta dishes and other fancy Italian things. Whatever. I just love the pizza.
4	2	6	4	2	************Like Eating In The Back Seat Of A Yugo*********** ...  ... The servers can't even maneuver between tables. ... YOU WILL rub elbows with the neighboring table. ...  ... ***********Use To Be A Top Notch Italian Restaurant********* ...  ... It seems they went on an aggressive expansion plan......about 5 years ago. ... The food quality slipped.......BIG TIME. ... Prices rose.......BIG TIME. ...  ... Now its kinda of..........an over priced Olive Garden. ... .......and in my opinion Olive Garden is DRECK .
4	5	0	0	0	In the 13 years that we've been going to Nick's, every visit has been perfect!  Perfect food, perfect service, perfect atmosphere! By far my favorite Italian restaurant!
4	2	9	24	13	We go to Nick's about once a year.  For the most part our experience has been positive. ...  ... I tend to order pasta dishes while my wife enjoys the Chicken Parmigiana.  Both could be better and the place can get crazy crowded at times.  The tight space and food reminds me of Giuseppe's on 28th http://www.yelp.com/biz/giuseppes-on-28th-phoenix  Though I like their food better. ...  ... Sometimes you just don't feel like cooking.  When it comes to Italian food, how many of us want someone else to do it better?  In this department, Nick's is just okay.  ...  ... The new management at New York 51 Pizzeria (formerly Redendo's) up the block might have the edge on Nick's. Time will tell. ...  ... http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-51-pizzeria-scottsdale ...  ... Sorry!
4	4	1	2	1	Let me preface this by stating my mother is FROM ITALY. Finally ordered from here after hearing countless good reviews about this place from multiple sources.  Ordered takeout on a Friday night as the wait was for over an hour.  I ordered the baked ziti, the bf ordered the lasagna. This place is legit.  It's fantastic.  Absolutely great food, quality ingrediants and made me really feel like I was eating in Italy.   ...  ... The people are super nice and very polite, which is always nice.  The only downside is this place is packed all of the time and it is really very small.  The parking location is next to a Circle K, which always carries a very interesting aroma.  Aside from that this will be a repeat establishment.
4	5	0	0	0	Very good! Probably best to get there early, it's a small establishment and can get quite busy. The calamari and bruschetta were excellent! I had Chicken Marsala which was very tasty, but a humongous portion! I had a taste of the marinara sauce and Italian ice cream and both were quite good. Definitely recommend it!
4	4	4	6	7	Thanks to Groupon, we found the gem in our neighborhood.  The dining room is small, so when it's busy, tables are tough to find.  There are only a few chairs next to the hostess stand and it can get really crowded there during peak hours. ...  ... We've ordered the following menu items: ...  ... Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $10.95 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ#T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ ...  ... 10" Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza w/Gorgonzola Cheese, $9.45 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw#vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw#U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw ...  ... Baked Ziti, $9.95 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg#HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg ...  ... The Gnocchi & Baked Ziti is delish.  They cook the Gnocchi just the way I like it, al dente.  The Better Half enjoys her Baked Ziti with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and they oblige her with that special order. ...  ... The Pizza is very very good.  I love Pizza and they do a great job here. ...  ... The service here is good, I wouldn't say excellent. ...  ... Return Factor - 90%
4	3	0	2	1	Wasn't especially impressed. Found it odd that the staff was busy getting frks to the empty tables rather than customers (us) with food on the table. Note to staff: get utensils to sitting customers first.  ...  ... Everywhere I've ever been, when it says Chicken Parmesan on the menu, it means breaded. Theirs wasn't. If you're going to deviate from 95% of the restaurants in the world, maybe you ought to put that fact on the menu?  ...  ... Might eat here in an emergency Italian craving, but won't go out of my way.
4	5	0	1	0	This is a simple-looking Italian restaurant in a small strip shopping center, but don't let the looks deceive you.  The menu is varied, and every dish I've tried has been fantastic.  The Calzone is stuffed full of excellent cheese and whatever ingredients you choose to add.  It's sized as a meal for two.  The lobster raviolis are excellent, with lots of real lobster chunks.  No fake fillers or small quantities here.  Even the salads are exceptionally prepared and great. ...  ... It's a little ways from the more commercial parts of the city, but worth driving out to.
4	3	0	0	0	Nick's spaghetti bolognese is what I crave on one of those "eat your feelings, carb overload" type of days. It is soo good. Unfortunately everything else I've tried (pizza, chicken Marsala, Alfredo) were all just so-so at best.  I've learned my lesson though and will continue to return for the bolognese!
4	5	0	1	0	Been coming to Nicks for years and its still my favorite place. I keep coming back for the Chicken Parm and cannolis!! This place is a staple in Scottsdale, best Italian food around for miles. I dream about their food. Authentic, classic, innovative - they have it all.
4	4	1	0	2	The Veal Marsala deserves 5 Stars. ... Service was good, but the appetizer came out just a couple minutes before our entrees.  Plus, we weren't able to make a reservation, and even though we called ahead, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.   ... At least they gave us some water while we waited. ... My girlfriend thought her pizza was "just OK," but it was definitely a good value. ...  ... I would come back just to have the Veal Marsala again.  ... Overall though: ALMOST excellent.
4	3	1	3	1	Got a touch lost one day and happened to drive by Nick's and decided to give it a go for dinner that night.  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Grilled Chicken and my fiancee had the Baked Ziti with Sausage.  Get the Ziti if you order either of these two dishes.   ...  ... The Fettuccine was very al dente, which some prefer - but it was almost to the point of under-cooked and close to crunchy, not my thing.  The Baked Ziti on the other hand was very good.  The sausage on it was cooked perfectly and the noodles didn't taste nearly as under-cooked.   ...  ... If you order only one thing from this place get the Tiramisu!  That dessert definitely put this place back in play for us to return.  It was light, airy, delicious and not too sweet or too mocha-y.  My non-coffee drinking fiancee loved it and my addicted coffee self loved it too!   ...  ... Overall: B- (with a huge A+ for the dessert)
4	3	0	0	0	This review is only for the location on Frank Llyod Wright.  This location is the main one, which the owner frequents most often.  It is open and very light.  Everyone sits at a table, there are no booth and no bar.  The food here is a bit better then the location on Tatum.  The pizza is a great price.  Large cheese pie is less than $13.00...the sauce is  a tad salty but if you ask them to put extra basil on the cheese it lessens the taste of the salt.  The pasta here is better than the other location and the wait staff it good.  There are many other places to eat Italian food in the area, but this place is good with the same crowd coming in day after day.  The meatball subs and seafood pasts dish are pretty tasty.  Great inexpensive place for linch.
4	5	0	0	0	Love this place! I have been going for a few years now and have never been dissatisfied with a dish or service. For starters, they bring out a great assortment of bread. I have tried many of their dishes and they have all been very good. I love to get the grilled vegetable salad with grilled chicken and a side of the arrabiata sauce. I have found it to be the perfect combination. My boyfriend gets the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine is amazing. They make the pasta in house and cook it perfectly. Great neighborhood restaurant!
4	2	0	0	0	Our first time at this restaurant and was not impressed.  It was kind of busy and we decided to wait for the 15 or so minuets. A party of four arrived about  10 minutes after us and were seated after about 5 minutes. After about 10 more minutes we were seated at a table in a high traffic area and were continually being bumped. They did have a seating list but were seating people out of order.  The bread was cold and dry and the salad was nothing special ( way over priced for what you got).  Pizza was above average and my wife ordered gnocchi it was not traditional very thick and gummy. We ordered the tiramisu which was pretty good and the service was good. We will probably pass on returning, the place was very chaotic and loud.  Definitely not a place to go if you want to talk unless you like using your outside voice.
4	4	0	0	0	Saw this on our way home today and decided to stop in - not a lot of stuff in the little strip mall so I assumed it was just a pizza place. ...  ... Boy was I wrong. As soon as you walk in the door you see that it's a little more special than 'just another pizza place'. It's clean and cozier than I expected from the outside. My husband ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and I ordered Chicken Ravioli. Their pastas are handmade (I didn't review the entire menu close enough to see if they all are, but there was quite a good selection of home made pasta). ...  ... The garlic bread is VERY yummy, I had a piece while we waited for dinner and then used a couple more to schmutz around in the pink sauce served with my ravioli. ...  ... Our waiter was Anthony - and he looked like he was from New York for sure! He was very polite, he and the other gentleman were very attentive. There was a cute blonde gal working tables, too, she was a little chatty for me - just when I was ready to point out how chatty she was to my husband she started talking about how good the pizza was at some other restaurant. ...  ... Then she mentioned that their pesto was better than "ours". Um. . . . Really? Then she mentions something about another restaurant to yet another table before we left this evening. I neglected to do my Review from the restaurant, so I forgot what that particular subject was about. Quite annoying to hear the wait staff discuss what they like about another restaurant, over THEIR restaurant..... especially annoying when it's the same food type as the one that they work in. ...  ... Nonetheless, we loved Nick's and will be going back. Maybe next time we'll try their pizza, I've ready a couple of reviews about how good it is.
4	4	0	2	0	Very good Italian Food, but didn't quite live up to my expectations...   ...  ... Wait For Table = 2.5 stars ... Service = 3.2 stars ... Atmosphere = 4.0 stars ... Beverages = 3.7 stars ... Appetizers = 5.0 stars ... Entre = 3.9 stars ... Dessert = 4.4 stars
4	5	4	5	5	Where has this place been hiding. Took my wonderfully beautiful girlfriend here on a surprise date after we saw a movies. This is one of her favorite restaurants and I wanted to try it out. Plus take her out for a nice dinner. ... Everything was very nice. Very unassuming little place in a nondescript strip mall. Everyone inside was very friendly. The food was amazing. Some of the best Americanized Italian food I have ever had. Of course if you want authentic Italian food you have to go to Italy or make it yourself. I got the risotto and my girlfriend got the gnocchi. We shared. Trying bites of each others dishes. I couldn't decide which one I like more. They were both so good. The gnocchi was very tender and fresh but the risotto was no slouch either. It was a great meal. Even the bread they brought out was very good. The price was very reasonable too. Not as expensive as I was thinking it was going to be. ... We will definitely be back. I really want to try a pasta dish because I am told they use fresh homemade pasta. I think if I didn't like this place my girlfriend would have dumped me on the spot.
4	4	0	0	0	If you like calamari get the Di Mare salad.   It is served with a house vinaigrette dressing, nice & light! and loaded with grilled calamari & shrimps.  As I allergic to shrimps, I get it with extra calamari and it is so delicious, perfect for a low carb diet! The servers here are so friendly and helpful, I frequent this establishment especially for lunch that they k ow ,e and being a creature of habit, I always order the same item, the Di Mare salad, "sin camarones"!
4	4	2	0	0	Nick's saved the day before baby Jesus's birthday! ...  ... We'd had a leisurely xmas eve full of working out, breakfast tacos and going to the movies. Suddenly, it was that late-afternoon/early-evening time (around 4:45-5:00) and we found hanger levels quickly approaching. We had planned for  a Christmas Eve feast at Oregano's like last year, but those assholes decided to give their employees an extra holiday day off. What is this, communist Russia? ...  ... So we drove aimlessly and tried to figure out who the heck was open on December 24. As we rounded the bend of FLLW Blvd. I remembered my old coworkers used to love coming to Nick's for their lunch special, and that we were in close proximity of the place. Boyfriend gave them a quick call to see if they would be open and sure enough, they would be until 9:00 p.m. DONE. ...  ... We were one of only about three other tables in the place when we got there, but like I said it was a weird "very early-bird diner" time. Had we eaten at a regular time, we'd have to wait, as I saw each and every table fill up in our time dining (and a line forming!--make a reservation if you want to eat at a "normal" dinner time.) ...  ... We split lots of things, because hey, holidays, fat, lazy, etc. We started with the bread basket, using the garlic and rosemary (!!) infused olive oil on the table for dipping. I could have made a meal out of the garlic knots in the basket and that godly oil. Perfection. Next was the bruschetta, because carbs are what baby Jesus wants us to eat. Their version uses tomato, onion, capers, black olives and with a shake of parm and a drizzle of aforementioned EVOO, it was outstanding. ...  ... We decided to be bad and each order a pasta dish, plus a small Mediterranean pizza. I KNOW. WHO CARES. I'M WORKING OUT LOTS LATELY. I opted for the penne carciofi, which had an abundant amount of artichoke chunks dispersed throughout the pasta, all covered in a bright, lemony white wine sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and when the sauce was scooped up with the bread? DONE. BF got the fettuccine with homemade sausage that came with peppers, onions and a marinara/wine sauce and said it was outstanding. The Med pizza had all the standards: kalamatas, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, arti's, feta. It was tasty, don't get me wrong--but to be honest, the pasta was the star of the show. We both said that we need to come back to try EVERYTHING on the menu. The only thing I would have liked more was an offer for cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper , but to be honest, we were so busy hoovering our food that we didn't even ask for these...I'm sure they are available. ...  ... Service was good. I don't know why but I was absolutely chugging water that evening, which I try not to do in restaurants, but both our server and the busser/food runner were quick with refills. Our server's name was Tony and he looked like a tiny Soprano's extra. Glorious. Like I said, the place was absolutely packed when we left, so Nick's knows what they are doing. We will soon be part of the wait crowd!
4	4	0	0	0	We love to come here for a casual date night. I always order the Pasta Primavera with gluten free penne and cream sauce. It's not too heavy and tastes fresh. I love and respect that they offer a gluten free pasta. I would love to see them expand the options, or at least offer gluten free bread :)
4	4	1	0	0	I drove past this place and thought man these guys dont look like they'll be busy. I walked in on a Tuesday night at it was Packed! That was nice to see. Seems to be an authentic family and felt like a little Italy. I had the Mediterranean Pizza and the Ziti. The pizza was delicious and I was surprised. The ziti was pretty good as well. Over all I will stop by again.
4	4	0	0	0	First time at Nick's Saturday night.  The place was packed but it was only 10 minutes before we were seated.  Ordered the chianti which was reasonable for $7.  The bread served in the basket consisted of various types--regular italian, foccacia, garlic knot?   All fresh.  The olive oil on the table which was infused with rosemary and roasted garlic was a nice accompaniment to the bread.  Ordered Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was served with linguini.  It was good, but disappointed that the portion consisted of only 5 shrimp.  6 would have been minimally more acceptable.  How do Chinese restaurants serve 10 shrimp for almost half the price? How do they do that?    ... Hubby had chicken with eggplant which was a special order.  He had it with vegetables--broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  The portion was very generous and the up charge for the special order was $2 over the chicken parmagiana price.  I thought that was fair.   ... Jeff was our server.  He answered the questions we had about the menu and was very attentive throughout our meal.   ... I will definitely try Nick's again maybe at lunch to check out their sandwiches.
4	4	0	0	0	What a lovely modern Italian place hiding in a strip mall in Scottsdale! Visited family recently and they took us out to dinner, practically off the plane. A nice, quiet interior, tastefully decorated and with very good service - solicitous without being pushy, a rarity these days. The food was very well prepared, in reasonable portions and served with flair. And best of all, it was exactly what the menu described! I would have given it 5 stars, but there were just too many table crammed into the rather small space. This is the one establishment I would happily return to on our next visit.
4	4	0	0	0	I absolutely love this place. The food is always outstanding. The service is very good as well. The atmosphere is a little bit cafeteria like but they make up for it with the food and service. Prices are reasonable. There isn't much of a waiting room so if there is a waiting list, you are standing around kind of in the restaurant. The restaurant is small so some of these things are a bit awkward.
4	5	0	0	0	Nick's is always a stopping point for us when we are in Scottsdale.  We have been going to Nick's for years.  Great Italian food at very affordable prices.  Nick is almost always there when we go so it is always nice to say hello.  Staff is great but we do miss our favorite server, Terry, as she has retired.  Weekends can be pretty busy, especially in season so go early to avoid a wait.  They will take reservations for parties of 6 or more only.  Looking forward to many more years to come at Nick's!
4	4	0	1	0	Great service, great food. 4 stars only because leftovers so caked with butter I was unable to remove leftovers from styrofoam. I had to drain a solid two tablespoons of butter from microwaved leftovers.
4	2	0	0	0	Nice restaurant inside. Nice location. Excellent staff. I dont like leaving negative reviews, but the food was "edible" at best. No flavor and everything tasted like it was out of a can. I'm glad we had a groupon that someone bought us or else I would have had a tough time coughing up the $50 for dinner. Maybe it was an off night for them...who knows. Don't think we'll be going back. Try Marco's Italian bistro up the road. Great place.
4	2	0	0	0	This may be the most over rated place ever!  OMG the stuff is so absolutely average at best. The staff when you walk in remixed me of an episode of restaurant stakeout. I tried it but I won't be back.
5	1	1	2	1	You sneaky little bastards you. I curse your existence.  ... I get home yesterday to find one of many credit card offers from what I though was capital one credit card.  ... I always get offers from them so I figure why not finally get a card from them.  ...  ... I call in to a automated system, plug in all my info and right as I hang up I look at the credit card promotional offer paper I got in the main and I noticed that it's not Capital One, rather it's Credit One.  ... You pieces of donkey feces.  ... Their logo looks identical to that of Capital One, which I'm sure was done on purpose. ... I immediately try to call back to cancel my application, but it was impossible to get an actual person to talk to, no matter how many times you pressed 0!  ... Finally I googled them to find another phone number and after struggling with the machine again I got to a operator after a 20 minute wait.  ... It was some foreign lady with a hard accent and could not understand me. I had to repeat everything about 5 times  ... Finally she understood me and canceled my application (at least I hope she did).  ...  ... Sly bastards.
5	1	1	4	0	I forgot to mention that I when I accidentally signed up (because I thought they were capital one) they also sent me a $75 bill, for no reason! Before I even got the card (not that I wanted the card).  ...  ... Jerks, I hope this crappy company goes out of business.
5	4	1	1	0	They're okay.  I get to pay my bills online so I'm a fan.
5	1	1	5	0	Fees! Fees! Fees! Don't sign up for this card. They will charge you a fee for opening the card. They will charge you a fee for authorized user. They will charge you a fee for the "premium design" of the card itself. And, they will charge you a fee to pay the fees online! I would give them zero stars if I could!
5	1	0	4	0	For starters, why are six very valid complaints filtered?  Maybe this one will get filtered too. ...  ... I love how they show their physical location on the map as being at the airport. ...  ... I wish I had read these reviews before I signed up.  Their latest stunt was to charge me a monthly fee that pushed me over my paltry limit by $1.17 and they sent an "overlimit" to my credit report.  Nice!  I'm trying to rebuild my credit and they are going to do more damage. ...  ... I just moved too, and I'm afraid to put in a change of address!  Closingthis account ASAP.
5	5	3	6	0	I am giving this card 5 stars because I read all the other reviews and am surprised by how many people are mad that they signed up for a card without reading all the info first! You THOUGHT it was Capital One? That's your fault right there! You're giving all your personal info to these people, maybe you should know who is receiving it. I knew I was paying a $75 fee for signing up, they just took it out of my credit and I paid it (in full!) on my first bill. Sure, no one reads all the terms and conditions on everything they sign up for, but you read the first damn page with all the info and the NAME of the company. I have received no surprise fees (as of yet, of course), I try to pay my card in full when it is due (except this last time, I paid half), and I use the plain grey card they sent me because paying extra to have a picture of my dogs face on the card just didn't seem worth it!
5	1	0	4	0	Worst Credit Card I've owned to date. Seriously no matter what situation you are in you are better off not working with this bank. ...  ... Signed up got hit with a hidden $75 fee right off the bat. Hidden fees EVERYWHERE. They take the notion of getting "big banked" to a new level.  ...  ... Made an online payment 3 days late for double the minimum payment.  I thought i was paying a payment and a late fee. Turns out I was making one for the payment I missed and one for the payment not due for 27 days.I get calls days later saying I need to pay more money as I made two payments toward my card and no payment toward late fee. I ask can you just move the payment not due for 27 days to the late fee and I'll make another payment before it is due. Them - "Sir our system doesn't do that. We are trying to help you out today. Don't you see all the help we are offering. Now I need your debit card to charge the late fee to"  ...  ... Mind boggling. Easily the worst, most aggressive horrifying card I've owned to date.
5	1	1	3	0	One of the worst customer service ever. I've had my card for over 5 years. I've been past due on the payment date, but never delinquent (30 days past due). I appreciate reminder phone calls but their customer service is out sourced to India. I received a reminder call recently from a male person who obviously spoken English as a second language, was extremely rude and condescending. He was literally interrogating me on why I hadn't paid my bill. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the supervisor wasn't even sure what credit card they were calling about. I tried to call the next day and couldn't talk to anyone in the U.S., even when I asked for the collections department. I have a small balance so this will be paid in full and I may only keep it for my credit history and emergencies. P.S. Do they pick their names out of a hat? Jennifer. Really!  BTW, Capital One's customer service is excellent!
5	1	0	1	0	I had this card for about two years, just paid it off.  Not recommended as this card is designed to make money off persons who have bad credit, so they can hit you with fees.  I don't like the outsourcing customer service outside of US, when there is adequate talent pool in Las Vegas looking for work.  I asked the US customer rep to talk to CEO about this, she said write him, I asked for his email, she said no, I need to write a letter, who the heck writes letters anymore??
5	1	0	0	0	This credit bank is a scam based pariah!  First I received an unsolicited credit card in the mail.  I chose NOT to "activate" because I did NOT apply.  After one week, I received BILL for $75.00 as an annual fee!  When I called this "bank" to state this information and asked for PROOF of an application, I was promptly disconnected.  BEWARE!  This is possibly aimed at the elderly who would not notice details but would rather simply pay.
5	1	1	4	0	Absolute scam. Preys on ignorant consumers. These people should be thrown in jail.
5	1	0	1	0	I only wish I had read the review first on this company.  Sadly I was also hit with a lot of "hidden" fees and it was all in the fine print supposedly.  They hit you with a $75 annual fee and a fee for which type of card print you want.  When I called to request that the fees be credited or rescinded the girl (in India) said there wasn't anything she could do but deduct $25.  I said I still would like to cancel the account and she said that's fine but never deducted the fees she initially gave me since I'm now cancelling the account.  A complete nightmare and poor business practices of this company.   ... Awful...do no get suckered in to doing business with these people.
5	1	0	4	0	$100 in fees in less than a month and I haven't even used the card!!! RUN RUN RUN! I'll agree...easily the worst card ever! But at some point the US Government will get a hold of their scam and they will be shut down.  I have had the card less than a month and will pay the $100+ balance and close it out just to save the grief! Should have seen the HUGE red flag when they called and called for me to actually activate my card! Just read our warning and learn from our mistakes.  I'm shocked they have gotten away with it for so long, but it's only a matter of time.  I'll be filing my case with BBB and spreading the word. All we can do is do the same and try to help others from making the same mistake. And to Credit One Bank, enjoy the ride cause your days are numbered!
5	5	0	3	0	Im with Kimberly B...this is a card for people rebuilding credit.  Mine got tanked due to a divorce.  I have been rebuilding, and started with a $300 limit, and it is now at $1250.  I do not carry a balance, ever.  If you need to carry a balance, then you haven't learned your lesson that got us all to this type of a card in the first place.  It you are a day late, you haven't learned your lesson either. A day late is a  day late. You can sign up to get reminders to pay a week in advance.  Also, it is NOT A HIDDEN $75 fee.  It isn't hidden!  It's clearly disclosed, along with the $8.95 monthly fee.  People who place blame where it doesn't belong aren't going to take responsibility for getting their credit back in order.  Get over it.  It's a card to rebuild credit...you are going to pay for the privlege of doing so.  I will probably keep it awhile longer, as length of time you have an account open adds to your score too.  Educate yourselves people. Stop blaming the company for being a business and take your finances into your own hands.
5	1	0	1	0	After being approved, I was mailed the card. Minimum limit, although I have other cards. Initially, I thought it was a Capital One invitation. Had I realized it was not, I would have further researched this company and passed. I did not receive a statement. Called the number and was told I would be charged an additional $9.95 to make payment. I did not approve that. I would wait and mail a check...they were going to cut the PAYMENT FEE in half...again, NO thank you. They waived the fee. Then the rep insisted, said we were GOING TO UP my payment by $25.00. Um, NO. I'm making more than your minimum, I've NEVER been harassed by any company to UP my payment amount...the first rep then handed me off to a Customer Service Specialist...WHY? I don't know....AFTER another few minutes, he passed me off to Customer Service Rep THREE, who ONCE AGAIN, tried to INSIST I UP my payment. I have been on the phone and wasted more than 25 minutes just to make a simple payment. No thanks. There are PLENTY OF GOOD companies that will assist you in rebuilding your credit, Victorias Secret is one, and they are great to deal with. They offered me my first card following my divorce...!  And it looks pretty good on me, I would say give it a go! In my personal opion, I would say... Think twice about this company.  If you can afford all their FEES, put your money away and get a prepaid credit card from your bank. It's YOUR money AND you can rebuild your credit, with NO OUTRAGEOUS FEES!! Their fees are VERY HIGH...there are other cards with more moderate fees, better customer service and reputation. Customer service is contracted in India, ( not a bad thing, but come on, if your an American Company. Outsourcing customer service is pretty low. Even DirecTV discontinued outsourcing after years of problems and complaints. Reps are hard to understand, and that's just a fact, not an opinion. I'm not calling this out as a bias, I had to ask a few times to have something repeated. There was never once in MY conversation a "thank you, excuse me, or how can I help you...?" that goes a long way with ME. Unpleasant to deal with, and take A LOT of your time...(how much are YOU WORTH an hour),  and a hard sell to increase your payment...  For me, NO THANKS. I will not use this card any longer. Thanks, but no thanks. - Feb 09, 2014
5	1	0	1	0	This is honestly the WORST card I have ever owned. I pay more than the minimum payment and my balance NEVER seems to go down. I called their customer service and can never get a straight answer. Their customer service department is BY FAR THE RUDEST customer service I have ever dealt with. I cut up my card as I did my other credit cards.. so I went on to make my payment and I was for some reason locked out. I could not reset my password because I dont have my CC. I called customer service and this stupid indian lady kept telling me she would mail me a pin. I could NOT for the life of me make her understand I wanted my password reset. For about 5 minutes this went on until I said "can i please speak to someone who knows what they are doing" she YELLED back at me that she KNOWS what she is doing. I said I would like to speak to a supervisor.. she said "may I ask what this is in regards to" UM DUH! I said I dont want to talk to you anymore. She kept me on hold for 7 minutes and her attitude was alot nicer when she came back on. She FINALLY figured out I wanted my PASSWORD reset and goes h no sorry I am not able to do that. I thought you wanted a new pin because your CC wouldnt work.. WOW I told her 4 times throughout the call that I CUT UP my card. I had missed a payment by 1 day and I called customer service and asked if they could reverse the 25 fee..this dude proceeds to give me a lecture about how I need to learn to pay my bills on time. I told him it was an accident and he said "there are no excuses man, we will not do this for you again" NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE DUDE!!!  RUN! THIS CARD IS NOT WORTH IT!!! THE FRUSTRATION OF DEALING WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.
5	1	0	5	0	I am on hold with customer service again and this is my first payment. I only got this card for my sons use. I simply opened a letter with a Credit Card offer and logged in and the card was sent. I am not complaining about the fee because that was my mistake but after the first month of usage I started receiving phone calls from East Indians who you can hardly understand asking me for payments over the phone which I NEVER do. So I came home attempted to log into my account but couldn't so I called on a Saturday "closed". Called Monday and asked about my problems with logging on and was told that my account was locked because my account was temporarily closed because I didn't make my payment. ...  ... Ok, first I was never sent a statement. I was not at 30 days since first use of card. I couldn't access to make a payment. I couldn't reach anyone on a weekend to discuss payment options. ...  ... Now this brings me to this current time as I am typing this... I am still on hold after making a payment over the phone and being transferred to the (couldn't understand what they said department) but I was hoping to speak to someone that could help with login issues. Anyways another East Indian tells me that I can't access my account until I provide verification from my bank? I asked for what and he replied to open my account again. I said I don't understand I need to access my account to make payments, watch activity, etc. Again, you need to send verification from your bank that you made a payment. Again, I said "huh", I just made an over the phone payment when that payment clears will my account unlock so I can access my account online? He said not until you mail in your verification from the bank.  ...  ... So here is the good part, OK I want to close my account! He says it's already closed! I asked so do you mean to tell me I have no further action to close my account permanently? No, it's closed. I am waiting to speak to a supervisor 33 mins and still holding.  All in all this is one of those cards that will fee you to death and at any point that you use it they will not send statements, lock you out of your account and charge you a $9.95 fee for overt the phone payment. RUN, RUN, RUN as people say. ...  ...  Close your account and stop the bleeding. Ok, 36 mins in and the call was disconnected.  ...  ... I am going to talk to a supervisor and ensure the account is closed at my request and follow through in a couple of weeks. The rough part is I can't go online to ensure the account was closed, you can't trust the people you talk with...... I guess I will have to purchase some type of credit monitoring to ensure they didn't add some type of fee to close my account for which they will send you no statement, no email for this fee that could potentially damage your credit for nonpayment of something you knew nothing about..
5	1	0	2	0	scam!!!! scam!!! scam!!!!  do notttt get this card! i have had many credit cards in my life including gold amex business and personal.. we developed credit issues because of medical bills. we ended up in bankruptcy. after a time we were working on rebuilding credit. i received a capital 1 account.... i worked on good payment history. soon, i received another offer. credit 1.....  horrific experience!!!  when i activated card is when a fee was assessed... then on top of high interest there is a large fee if you lose card and if you call to make phone payment it is a $9.95 fee to do this by phone - the problem is it's all scams to cause more fees, fees and more fees. so, ... i called to make payment to pay off account. i paid and asked over and over if all fees and everything were paid off.  i was then shipped over to a guy trying to keep me. i explained my position and said i wanted  to pay and close account... he says ok.. he processed my payment and said all was paid....  ...    i was getting a weird gut feeling that things were not right. ... i decided to call about a month later... the guy says i have a balance of $10.  -----  and there was a $9.95 charge to pay my balance... they  seem to be in control of your credit and extort people and drag them into web of deciept and supper feeeeeeeeeeees!!! i am now forced to file complaint with gov. please take extreme caution!!!!
5	1	1	4	1	Don't open an account with this company. You will regret it I promise. I spent many calls and wrote letters to customer service and to two execs with the company and received no responses. Their Facebook page won't allow any posts which I am sure is to prevent customers from commenting on the extremely poor service. I made multiple calls over the last two months and continue to get transferred from caller to caller including those that speak very little English. On the last call, they disconnected my call after being on about 40 minutes with various customer service representatives.  ...  ... The problem resulted from Credit One processing a payment much later than it should have been processed resulting in a late fee rolling into my March statement. I made a payment over the phone in February with one of their representatives that should have brought my account to a -0- balance. My bank, CapitalOne, also verified that this was an electronic payment and not a check mailed. However, for some reason, Credit One did not process this payment until March 6th, almost two weeks after I made the payment over the phone. This resulted in a late payment of 29.07 being assessed on my account in my March statement on 3/5. I made calls in March and in April trying to get this resolved, but experienced horrendous customer service. As a result of their representatives not being able to resolve this, I had another late payment of 33.41 assessed on 4/5.  ...  ... You can't reach anyone at their corporate offices as well and NO REPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am moving forward with a complaint with the BBB.
5	1	0	2	0	Horrible Credit card... This Credit One Bank Visa Platinum is an absolute scam. They charge a Daily finance so even though you paid your balance in full they still charged interest. You can not use this card without being charged a fee, a ridiculous fee, not to mention the enrollment fee. They also charge you $9.99 if you want to pay early? that's F'd up I'm done with these guys and will stop my card with them and continue to bash them as they continue to suck. Oh by the way I received an email after my balance was due in order for them to slap me with a $25 late fee... Seriously Credit One goto Hell. The owner is probably a son of a sea biscuit anyway. The fact of the matter is this I don;t need you ... but you need me.
5	1	1	2	1	I have power of attorney for my elderly, ailing mother. Mailed it to them 2 weeks ago because they don't have a fax (yeah, right) and still not showing it in their system.  ...  ... He got my mom on the line to approve me speaking to them about her account which she did but all he would do is give me her balance and started hounding me on when *I* was going to make payments on her account for her. ...  ... I explained that I was calling to cancel the card (which the power of attorney authorized) and to make payment arrangements for the money to AUTOMATICALLY come out of HER account starting at the end of this month when she gets her check. ...  ... He then tells me that isn't acceptable and something has to be paid NOW and that I should pay it from MY own account. ...  ... Transferred to a "supervisor" who then argues with me that I should mail the Power of Attorney again (only has a PO Box, no certified mail) OR I should call customer service to ask if they have the Power of Attorney.  (So, I am supposed to hang up with him, call the same number again to ask if they have it????)  It was lost on him how idiotic that was. Why do I have to hang up with Credit One just to call Credit One back? HE should contact customer service while I am on the phone to verify the Power of Attorney. ...  ... I have NEVER had a company make it so hard to arrange to GIVE THEM MONEY!!! ...  ... This will be the last bill of hers that gets paid after the other companies get money
5	1	0	1	0	Caveats: ...  1) People always nice on the phone. ...  2) Payments processed like typical low end credit card company, so certain amount of money games expected. ... 3) The problem with this company are its customer service protocols. Their online system gets hacked, account suspended, OK fine, not a bad idea. But the hoops to go through to reestablish, which I followed & seemed to have vanished from your premises, are so cumbersome I gave up & closed the account.  ...  ... Guys, if you're making money doing with your Godawful practices well then bully for you. Your rating here on Yelp is tanked, were you to do something about it you might earn a whole lot more... ... Best Wishes, Good Luck & Good Riddance....
5	1	0	1	0	I have had this Credit One Bank Visa since March.  All going ok until one month I went over my credit limit by a $1.00 and some change.  They were calling to inform me that I had gone over my credit limit and they were requesting a payment!   The other wierd thing was the bill wasn't even due yet!!  I was like What!!  Your calling and the bill is not due yet?   Crazy!!  Then as someone else said, these East Indians!!  Ughhh...  Can't understand them!!  I say Why Me!!  Then, I asked to speak to this guy Mark's supervisor!   His name was Eric.  I let this guy have it!  Why in the world make a collection call when the bill isn't due yet??  So, I started doing some research on thus company!  I'm paying my bill  and closing this acct!  I admit got this to help my credit, but i can't deal with a company like this!!  It's so wrong what they do! ... Thanks to all the reviews!!
5	1	0	1	0	This is by far THE worst credit card company I've ever dealt with! Even if you are absolutely desperate to obtain a credit card to rebuild your credit score, DO NOT do business with these people. You will regret it. This company prays on the vulnerable and deliberately sets up people to go into debt. STAY AWAY.......STAY FAR AWAY from these dangerous dishonest crooks!!
5	1	0	1	0	WORST card ever!!! Don't fall in their trap. WORST customer service. Unfortunately they have nooooooo idea about customer service. Don't fall in their trap. Rip off!!!!!!!!
5	3	0	1	0	Had the card for nearly a year and hadn't had any issue. My balance has been 0 for some time now. Recently someone got ahold of my CC number and some fraudulent charges were made on the card. This was my first interaction with customer service. ... The complaint I have with the card is as far as when fraudulent charges are made, they send the claim to the "fraud department" to investigate. However, they can not give you the number to contact fraud department to speak about your case with them directly. They say they don't have access to the department. That seems very strange and fishy to me. It doesn't really put you at ease when in the midst of fraudulent charges are on your card that you can't speak with the department trying to sort the situation out. They also have a time frame ranging from 90 days as to how long your investigation can take. ... Thankfully, the department did find that my charges were not made by me in about 2-3 weeks and my card has already been credited.
5	1	0	0	0	Yelp please give us a Zero star score. This is an awful company. They prey upon the poor, minorities and those who truely want to make their credit better. They charge fees like a Las Vegas Craps table ( the expensive ones) Charging hundreds of dollars in imaginary fees a month. They can't answer your complaints. They have a phone bank in the Phillipines with customer disservice employees who you can hear in the background all reading the same script. Frightening that this exists in America
5	1	0	0	0	I would have given this a ZERO but yelp won't allow a post. I've had this card for 3 years, it was one of the first cards I got approved for on my own post divorce. I manage my credit because I am building and have never been late although they make that hard when you have to pay by their time zone, even online. I made a payment online 6 months ago and even though I  checked the box for it to come from my checking, it defaulted to my savings which is a different acc. number. I called them to let them know, before it came back and paid at that time, they cut me off online bill pay and cut the card off. I explained over and over and they requested a letter from my bank! I refused, I had never been late once. Fine, this is a chance for me to pay it off. I noticed my balance got higher not using the card! I can not get anyone on the phone in the states--out  sourcing makes it difficult to resolve issues. So frustrated that I want to get a lawyer to mediate but that would cost more than the balance. This is a fee based card that makes NO SENSE!!! They charged me 29.00 to get an increase on a card that I cannot charge on!!! They charged me 29.00 for being late on my payment when I called and made the payment. They read their own notes which stated that I called on my payment due date to check on my status. REALLY! I called to make my payment!!! They updated my card but never charged it..so I'm at fault because I didn't get a confirmation number. My bad, I never do..my bank is my receipt which is how I found out they didn't take the payment out!!!  ... I want these people outta my life!!!    IT'S A SCAM   I still don't know how my card is being charged when it is OFF. They make it hard to be compassionate and tolerant when they offer none back... They are based in Nevada and Georgia, why can't I get someone in the States!!! DO NOT GET THIS CARD!!!
5	1	0	0	0	Their credit card is more for people with no credit, but they approve just about anyone with bad credit too. I had their credit card back in 2001 when they were still FNBM (First National Bank of Marin). I used the card for many years, it was expensive but I had no complaints until I missed a payment one month. I figured I would just double up the next month being young and not grasping the importance of credit. Well, Day 45 the card charged off! That was pretty harsh. I would not do business with them. I was recently offered their card again and was like really?! My credit is way out of their league now.
5	5	0	0	0	Credit One bank will not give credit to anybody with average or above average credit. Its bad credit people only. Yes - you will get a written denial that your credit is too good if you are average credit. ...  ... Credit one bank only deals with risky people. For that reason they charge a lot of fees.  ...  ... Once you understand this it's easier to accept them for what they are. ...  ... In my case I am very happy with them. Back when I could not get any kind of a store card they gave me a chance. With a 300 credit limit (mind u I think I spent like $75 in fees) but off I was to helping my credit. ...  ... I should start by saying before my credit one card I had nothing, 6 collections, 1 lien, like 5 120+ day late on a current account. It was bad. My fico was 546. ...  ... Now im almost at the one year mark and I have a couple other cards, way higher limits, 650 fico and couldn't be happier. ...  ... My options were 1) credit one bank or 2) secured card. I did not care for the secured route as most don't graduate to unsecured.  ...  ... So I am 100% happy though I will likely be canceling them before the 1 year hits as I don't need it now that I have better cards with rewards and no fees. ...  ... Credit one bank (and first premier) are the reason my credit is starting to get better.
6	3	4	0	0	The thing I like best about The Gym is the name. If you need an excuse to go have a drink or what ever and your S.O. asks where you are going, now you can say, "The Gym." That being said, they do have a full bar and a cool drink menu, which I frequent by trying new drinks when ever I eat there. The food is decent bar food, wings and all the trimmings. I have heard its the best place in QC to get your groove on, but I have yet to catch that. If you live out in BFEQC, you should check it out for sure!
6	4	0	0	0	I LOVE the Gym!  They have the best nachoes I've ever eaten.  They are reasonably priced, nice place to hang out with my friends.  The other food I've had is decent, like Heather said it's decent bar food.  Weekends usually feature a DJ or sporting event (UFC pay per view, for a cover).  I've always had decent service.  And their drinks are reasonably priced: $5.50 for a nice rum-filled daquari
6	1	2	0	0	Over-priced drinks. Generic redbull that tastes like crap. Crappy DJ running of equipment and speakers that look like they came from Spencers in the mall. The bartenders & waitresses were fat. The drinks were weak and slow to come. The Guinness was flat. No wings or bar food after 10ish. I'd rather go to Bevmo and order wingstreet.

Tried a beer i've never had Agave wheat,  I think... very good. Bartender was great. Need to go back to try food, still not so sure about this place.

6	2	0	0	0	This price is overpriced and has crappy service. I was there in September and it's was really hot when we were eatting. I asked if they could turn the air down an they told me the air conditioner was broken.
6	3	0	0	0	Nice sports bar. I like the ribs and pulled pork sandwich. Appetizers are pretty standard. Plenty of TV 's in the place. Nice wait staff and fun people at the bar. It's also a nice dining place for family.
6	5	0	0	0	My friends and I did our annual Kentucky Derby Day here Saturday. It couldn't have been better. Jose promised the best breakfast burritos and totally delivered. I highly recommend getting the breakfast burrito with bacon AND ham. WOW that thing was amazing. We ate 5 plates of cheese curds between races because they're awesome. Anyway, if you're in the area anytime, stop by here. I still haven't been here in the evening or on a weekend night so I can't comment on that. Anyway, I personally give a thank you to Jose and our waiter for taking great care of my friends and I.

Try them with the spicy wing sauce... you will be addicted. If you order a steak, you will be given restaurant quality with a beautiful presentation of fresh green beans, wax beans, and carrots. If you order a burger, I suggest the Blue Bruiser with blue cheese and onion rings on top. AMAZING.  ...  ... The only thing keeping it from earning five stars is the service. I have been to The Gym four times with my kids and two times we had wonderful service but the other two times the service was slow and rude. Once, the waitress got the order wrong and never apologized and the second time it seemed that she had something better to do than her job. If you are not in a hurry and don't care about service, the food is worth it.

Just a low class dive bar that needs a complete make over. Stay away, there are better places to eat - Jack in the Box would be a better choice.

The burger is moist but not so greasy that it makes the bun soggy. The beer is really cold which is important to me, but the prices are high. There is a sign that reads...happy hour all day...but my draft was still $5.00 and we were there @ 4pm so the sign is bogus and there is no happy hour. I still am a fan.

6	1	0	1	1	Dirty, run down, and rude staff, not attracting the best patrons. Will make the drive for a better environment next time
6	2	0	0	0	Its an ok place,  but went on a FRIDAY night and they were out of ALL wine, tequila and a huge list of beer. Whaaaaaat? Be prepared or send someone to go stock up.
6	1	1	0	0	Terrible service, we waited almost an hour for our food; they brought us our appetizer but nothing else we told them we're leaving we are paying for the appetizer , we are not paying for anything else and left.
6	4	1	1	1	Chips and Salsa are a must have! Chips come out fresh and hot. Be sure to load the salsa on because you only get 1 free basket, the salsa is so delicious that I'm sure it won't be an issue.  The reuben was amazing, high quality meat, the bread is grilled so no greasy mess on your fingers from butter, and all the flavors meld perfectly together.  The seasoned fries were delicious. Our server was great! She kept our drinks refilled and made sure we had everything we needed. From my perspective it wasn't dirty or run down at all.

6	1	0	3	0	This place has turned into a horrible dive bar. I used to go here back in 2009-2010 and it was really good. I stopped going when it started smelling like raw sewage a couple years ago. I figured that I would give it another shot today. Smell is gone.  ...  ... This place needs to be on Bar Rescue. The manager sits at the corner of the bar drinking, cussing, and rolling silverware while the bartender talks to him and his buddies completely ignoring everyone else.  ...  ... Ordered some chicken fingers. 30 minutes later, I ask where they are. The bartender put them in but the kitchen didn't cook them. You can have them in 7 minutes they tell me. No thanks and thanks for checking on them over the last 30 minutes. I get a VERY insincere "sorry". No comp on anything. Manger doesn't say anything except to keep drinking and being a loud mouth.  ...  ... I will never go back to this dump. If you live in STV do yourself a favor and go to someplace like Native New Yorker or even Don Pedro's (which isn't great either but WAY better than the Gym).  ...  ... If I could give zero stars I would.
6	3	1	1	0	Not bad at all. Its a bar so expect under trained employees and staff. Foods good when it comes out and beers cold. Good for kids and families before 9pm. Come check it out. Better than native new Yorker.
6	1	0	0	0	This place use to be fun the first year it opened went back about a month ago what a dive will never go back
6	4	0	0	0	Once they notice you the service is great! Good prices (even if not in happy hou(s)) ... New food menu coming in a couple of weeks the crab is really good, though.
